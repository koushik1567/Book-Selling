        <p>  Lisa needs to disappear. And her friend's rambling old home in the wilds of Yorkshire seems like the perfect place. It's miles away from the closest town, and no one there knows her or her little boy, Joe.

            But when a woman from the local village comes to visit them, Lisa realizes that she and Joe aren't as safe as she thought.

           What secret has Rowan Isle House - and her friend - kept hidden all these years?</p>
