        <p> In the summer of 1940, as the world teeters on the brink of war, an elusive Nazi spy infiltrates the ancient halls of Westminster Palace, searching for a secret that could unleash a German invasion.

            Against this perilous backdrop, Jamie Wallace, the courageous son of a humble butcher, and Livy Ashford the determined daughter of Lord Randall Ashford, a confidant of Churchill, find their lives intertwined when they are thrust into grave danger. Suspicions turn out to be shockingly true as the destruction of their beloved country looms. In the face of extreme peril, their love for each other becomes their greatest strength.
            
            Winner of the prestigious Hemingway Award for 20th Century Wartime Fiction, Heart of the Few stands as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit amidst the darkest times. Being deeply loved gives one the strength to face unimaginable challenges and fight for the future. </p>
